Program 2
Part a
We simply wrote a program that read in input from either file or an input file
(using dup() and dup2() to redirect stdout). Then each line was parsed and saved 
into history which was a circular arry. Then we checked to see if the input line 
was a history or exit command. If it was neither, the line was passed to execvp
,after first forking the running process. Incorrect commands were caught there.

Part b
We added the getpinfo system call in the same way as with Program 1.
We moved the ptable struct into a .h file so that sysproc.c can access it.
We modified the allocproc function to setup each process at the highest priority
with one tick left at that level. Then in the scheduler code, we find the process
with the highest priority and run that. If there are multiple processes at the same
level, they Round Robin.
See graph.pdf for more info on how the graph was made.

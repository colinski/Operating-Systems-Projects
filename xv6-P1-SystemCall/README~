rangesort part:
For rangesort I simply read in the records and then used C's qsort() function to sort the records.
Then when I writing to the output file, I checked to make sure the values were in the given range.

xv6 part:
I used grep to find all the places where some other syscall (getpid) was mentioned.
I then mirrored that code to add my own syscall.
I added my counters to syscall.c since that it from where all syscalls are called and returned.

In total I edited the following files:
user/usys.S
user/user.h
include/syscall.h
kernel/sysfunc.h
kernel/syscall.c
kernel/sysproc.c

Program 5
Fall 2015

We changed bmap(), writei(), and readi() in fs.c to handle our new file type.
Some code had to be added in order to handle the new address structure, as well as
read and write the checksum value. Then in file.c, fstat() was changed so that 
it sets the stat struct's checksum field with the correct value. Then in our filestat 
program, a file path is read in as a command line arg. 
Then fstat is called and the contents of the stat struct are printed out.

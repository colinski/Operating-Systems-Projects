We created a simple queue using a linked list to store the
requests. After creating the threads, the worker threads
cond_wait on the queue being empty, and the producer thread
cond_wait on the queue being "full" (at the max size). After waking up
a worker dequeues a request and handles it, while the producer thread
enqueues a request.
